Dataset
Multi-Modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound (MMOTU) image dataset consists of two sub-sets with two modalities, 
which are OTU_2d and OTU_CEUS respectively including 1469 2d ultrasound images and 170 CEUS images. 
On both of these two sub-sets, we provide pixel-wise semantic annotations and global-wise category annotations. 
Many thanks to Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, 
Capital Medical University and their excellent works on collecting and annotating the data.

MMOTU : google drive (move OTU_2d and OTU_3d to data folder. Here, OTU_3d folder indicates OTU_CEUS in paper.)
